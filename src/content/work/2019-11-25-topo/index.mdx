## Introducing [Topo.sol](https://github.com/johnx25bd/topo-sol)

Currently in Parse.ly's Analytics Platform, there are no areas that lets a user know if they have historical data available to them past the limit they see. For example, if my site's plan has 1 year of data retetnion, I would be able to query traffic data as far back as 1 year from today, not knowing if additional data was available if I had an upgraded plan.

Common plans for data retention trail back one or two years, but many customer accounts have been with us for much longer. We collect data the moment an account successfully integrates Parse.ly's tracker, so for many folks, more data exists! We just have to let them know.
